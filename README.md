# Hall Effect in a Semiconductor Analysis (SHE)

Semiconductors have revolutionized modern society, and can be found in most electronics. This lab focuses on studying the Hall Effect in a semiconductor between temperatures 95K-350K. By following Van Der Pauw technique we were are able to measure the electrical properties of the Al doped Germanium slab along with the carrier type and mobility of the sample.
